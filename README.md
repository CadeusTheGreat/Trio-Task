# Trio-task
# What was the challenge?
The challenge was to make a flask app witha sql database and have them run in separate containers. All the secrets should be secure and not publicly available.
# How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be alright asides trying to use docker as I struggle with understanding that system. This expectation was proven correct when I couldn't submit a working challenge because I could not operate docker correctly.
# What went well?
Writing the docker files went well and they built with minimal changes needed after the first attempt.
# What didn't go as planned?
Using docker did not go to plan, after the building process, I couldn't work out how to assign names to the built images nor could I work out how to link them together and use the secrets system.
# Possible improvements for future challenges.
As I wasn't able to complete the challenge, I need to focus on learning docker more as I struggled to use it for the challenge. When built, the apps didn't get assigned names or tags and I couldn't set tags as no name was provided.
